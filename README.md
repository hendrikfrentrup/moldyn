# Molecular dynamics program for LJ fluid
## October 2010 by H. Frentrup, C. Avendano and E.A. Muller

This code was designed to study the diffusion behaviour of the Lennard Jones fluid in slit pores.

This branch `nemd` simulates a non-equilibrium fluid, where a force is applied at the system box's boundary in a direction orthogonal to the pore. The calculation of transport diffusion coefficients is possible via Fick's Law equation.
