# Molecular dynamics program for LJ fluid
## October 2010 by H. Frentrup, C. Avendano and E.A. Muller

This code was designed to study the diffusion behaviour of the Lennard Jones fluid in slit pores.

This branch `emd` simulates an equilibrium fluid, hence the calculation of self-diffusion coefficients via the Einstein equation is possible.
